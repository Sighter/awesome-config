Autostart module for the awesome window manager
===============================================

Name: autost
Author: Sighter


1. Installation
---------------

Unpack the tar file to your awesome config-dir.
e.g. $HOME/.config/awesome


2. Invocation
--------------

First load the module at the head of your rc.lua with
the command:

	require("autost")

Then you there are some possibilities for configuration

	autost.set.logging = true
	autost.set.logprefix = "\t--> autost :: "

The first option toggles logging to the standard-error
output. The second Option defines a string, which is appended 
at the beginning of every log message.


The third you have to do is to define a table with your automaticly
started programs. E.g.:

	autost.entries =
	{
		{ cmd = "screen -D -R -S irssi irssi", term = "urxvtc -n urx-irssi -e" },
		{ cmd = "mutt", term = "urxvtc -n urx-mail -e" },
		{ cmd = "slrn", term = "urxvtc -n urx-mail -e" },
		{ cmd = "firefox" },
	}

I think you get the synopsis. "cmd" have to be assigned with a command call.
If the spwaned program runs in a terminal, you have to provide the term key.
It holds the command of your favourite terminal emulator for executing a 
program directly.
This is necessary because only the strings in "cmd" are found in the "ps -Af"
output, in which the autostart function is looking for running applications.
Consequently , if you exit an app which is in your entries table and you
restart your awesome, then the program is spawned again. I will make this
behavior more controlable in the future.

At least you have to launch the main function at the and of your awesome 
configuration file with the call

	autost.execute()
